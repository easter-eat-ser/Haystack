### Haystack
## Open-source remake of Mother 3

Haystack is an open-source recreation of Mother 3, which aims to combine Mother 3 GBA's visual style and the N64's 3D capabilities. Some improvements will be made, and cut content can hopefully be added in some capacity.
This project is entirely open, because there's really no point to hiding progress behind fake walls.

Tools:
	- Blender 4.2 Stable LTS or earlier
	- Godot v4.3 Stable
